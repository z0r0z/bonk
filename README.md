# BONK
Bonkler Bid Bloc (BONK) pools ETH for shares to group bid on Bonkler NFTs (BNKLR) ðŸ”«ðŸ’¦.

Running [KaliV2](https://github.com/kalidao/keep) so that Moloch-style governance and ragequit can work with multisig for max flex but keeping stuff all on-chain. DAO shares are also expressive NFTs themselves!
